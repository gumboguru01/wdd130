        <p>
            Hi, my name is Nyashadzashe Gumboguru, and I’m a 25-year-old software engineering student at BYU–Idaho,
            proudly from Zimbabwe.<br><br>
            I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it's building websites or
            developing mobile apps, I love creating practical solutions that make life simpler and more
            connected.<br><br>
            Recently, I launched my own micro-company called <strong> <a
                    href="https://gumboguru01.github.io/ASL/">Access Soft Labs (ASL)</a></strong> a growing team
            focused on building smart, custom applications and websites that meet the unique needs of individuals, small
            businesses, and organizations.<br><br>
            I’m not married yet, but I’m fully committed to growing both personally and professionally. This journey
            with ASL and my studies is something I’m truly excited about, and I look forward to learning, creating, and
            making a meaningful impact alongside others who share the same passion for tech and innovation.
