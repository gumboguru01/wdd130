        <p>
            Hi, my name is Nyashadzashe Gumboguru, and I’m a 25-year-old software engineering student at BYU–Idaho,
            proudly from Zimbabwe.<br><br>
            I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it's building websites or
            developing mobile apps, I love creating practical solutions that make life simpler and more
            connected.<br><br>
            Recently, I launched my own micro-company called <strong> <a
                    href="https://gumboguru01.github.io/ASL/">Access Soft Labs (ASL)</a></strong> a growing team
            focused on building smart, custom applications and websites that meet the unique needs of individuals, small
            businesses, and organizations.<br><br>
            I’m not married yet, but I’m fully committed to growing both personally and professionally. This journey
            with ASL and my studies is something I’m truly excited about, and I look forward to learning, creating, and
            making a meaningful impact alongside others who share the same passion for tech and innovation.

            Zimbabwe is a beautiful country in Southern Africa known for its diverse wildlife and stunning natural
            wonders such as <a href="https://www.zambiatourism.com/destinations/waterfalls/victoria-falls/">Victoria
                Falls</a> and <a href="https://www.zimparks.org.zw/hwange-national-park/">Hwange National Park</a>. It's
            a land of rich <a href="https://www.zimbabwenlapset.org/en/culture-and-sports/">culture and history</a>,
            including the ancient ruins of <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/364/">Great Zimbabwe</a> and vibrant
            traditional communities. The country also boasts breathtaking landscapes—from the rolling Eastern Highlands
            to the wildlife-filled savannas—and a warm, welcoming spirit that makes it a truly special place to visit
            and explore.
